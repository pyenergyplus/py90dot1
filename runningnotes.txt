We may have critical-mass of code and documentation to start collaboration.

some of this may move back to eppy

- Appendix-G issues: @GinaRoddha, @MarinaChavez, @joeDeringer, @jasonglazer
- python code: @santoshphilip, @ncbrown, @jamiebull1
- E+ issues: @jasonglazer, 

1. `setallconstructions()` Set the construction to ASHRAE materials for all surfaces based on climate zone
    1. `surfacefilter()` **a.** Filter surfaces as roof, wall, floor, window
    2. `setconstruction()` Put in appropriate baseline construction for roof, wall, floor, window.
        - needs step **a.**
    - @ncbrown
2. `windowresizer()` Resize the windows as per Appendix-G rules
    - @Jamiebull1
3. `shaderemover()` Remove all the exterior shades
4. `selfshadeoff()` Turn off self shading in the building
5. `systemselector()` **A** Select the baseline mechanical system based on *Table G3.1.1-3*
    - @santoshphilip
6. `baselinesystem()` **B** Remove proposed mechanical system and insert baseline mechanical system
    - needs step **A**
    - `removesystem()` Remove mechanical system
    - `insertsystem()` Insert baseline mechanical system
    - @santoshphilip



7. `baselinerunner()` **C** do a sizing run of baseline model
    - needs all the steps before **A**
    - needs step **B**
    - **** not needed ****
8. `extractsizing()` **D** extract sizes from results of sizing run
    - needs step **C**
    - **** not needed ****
9. `insertsizing()` Insert the results of sizing run into model
    - needs step **D**
    - **** not needed ****


extraction of sizing not needed - autosize will do what is needed (differernt input for heating and cooling)

steps:
- update docs to reflect sizing runs
- update docs to reflect numbering of Appendix-G
- Document method for python coders in the python files
- Ask for collaboration help

bite the bullet and code everything in python3 ?

Need to use some package template, so I get all the bells and whistles
